        Tell me something
        When the rain falls on my face
        How do you quickly replace
        It with a golden summer smile?
        
        Tell me something
        When I'm feelin' tired and afraid
        How do you know just what to say
        To make everything alright?
        
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside
        Your universe

        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you but its just
        The other way around

        You can thank your stars all you want but
        I'll always be the lucky one

        Tell me something
        When I'm 'bout to lose control
        How do you patiently hold
        My hand and gently calm me down?
        
        Tell me something
        When you sing and when you laugh
        Why do I always photograph
        My heart flyin way above the clouds?
       
        I don't think that you even realize
        The joy you make me feel when I'm inside
        Your universe

        You hold me like I'm the one who's precious
        I hate to break it to you but its just
        The other way around
